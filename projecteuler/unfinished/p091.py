 Right triangles with integer coordinates

 The points P ( x _1 , y _1 ) and Q ( x _2 , y _2 ) are
 plotted at integer co-ordinates and are joined to the origin, O(0,0), to form \xce\x94OPQ.




 There are exactly fourteen triangles containing a right angle that can be formed when
 each co-ordinate lies between 0 and 2 inclusive; that is, 0 x _1 , y _1 , x _2 , y _2




 Given that 0 x _1 , y _1 , x _2 , y _2 < 50
