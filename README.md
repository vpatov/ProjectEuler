# ProjectEuler
Source code to solutions to various problems from projecteuler.net.

Feel free to message me at "vasiapatov@gmail.com" if you have any questions, discussion points, or even suggestions! Please include "Project Euler Github" in the subject e-mail.

Some of the puzzles are very fun, and many of them are challenging, I highly recommend it to those who want to give their brain a good workout.
